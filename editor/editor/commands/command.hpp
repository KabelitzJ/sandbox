/**
 * @brief One undoable editor action.
 *
 * Construct without mutating, then push via editor_state::push_command() (or
 * command_stack::push()), which calls execute() — never call execute()/undo() directly.
 *
 * Stores only math::uuids, never scene&/ecs::entity; re-resolves via target.find() inside
 * execute()/undo(), treating a lookup miss as a no-op. target is passed in explicitly by the
 * caller (editor_state::push_command()/undo()/redo(), see its doc comment) rather than resolved
 * internally, so the exact same command classes work unmodified against any scene a caller wants
 * to target — normally editor::active_scene(), but e.g. inspector_panel's prefab edit session
 * passes its own private scratch scene instead. Never storing target itself also keeps a command
 * valid across the registry rebuild scene_serializer::load() does on Play -> Stop.
 *
 * modify_component_command/add_component_command are idempotent (plain overwrite /
 * get_or_add_component), so a continuous drag can re-execute every frame. Node/script commands
 * are strict alternating toggles instead, since command_stack never calls execute()/undo() twice
 * in a row on the same state.
